This is a scanner for the Guild Wars 2 Trading Post, focused on maximizing profit margins on craftable items.

As long as an item id is provided and said item is tradeable on the trading post, it can return required base crafting materials, as well as profit margins on crafting.

An example of its usage can be found in Demo.ipynb.

Happy Crafting!
